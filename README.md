# Project overview
This project analyses transactional retail datasets from FNP (Ferns and Petals) - an online platform specialising in gifts shipping with a variety of products - to understand customer purchasing behaviour, their preferences, product performance, revenue trends and shipping efficiency.
The project aims to perform end-to-end Excel dashboard projects and simulate practical business workflow: from transforming data, performing aggregration by SQL, delivering calculation and trend patterns in Excel and presenting a business performance via an interaction dashboard.
